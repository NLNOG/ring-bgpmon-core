BGPmon 7.2.3 - ring1

BGP Monitoring System (BGPmon) is designed to monitor BGP updates 
and routing tables from BGP routers.

It uses modular architecture to scalably monitor many BGP routers
by distributed deployment while allowing a consolidated and neat 
interface to end users. BGPmon uses the Extensible Markup Language (XML) for BGP data. 
This format can accurately record BGP data without any information loss and
it is extendable for possible new features in BGP updates.
