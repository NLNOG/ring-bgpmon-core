1.	Introduction
To represent BGP routing data, BGPmon implements XFB as defined in draft-bartlett-xfb.
However, there is additional information specific to the operation of BGPmon itself that
is useful to administrators.  This document defines the extensions to the base XFB specification
that BGPmon implements.

2.	New Elements
BGPmon adds some new elements to the standard XFB specification to assist in statistic collection
and quality of service.  These are defined below.  Future revisions of the BGPmon software may
necessitate more such elements.

2.1		The BGPMON_SEQ node and loop detection
Because of the chaining ability of BGPmon, it is possible for messages to loop.  To
avoid this, every BGPmon instance generates a random ID and starting sequence number.  Then, 
every outgoing message is tagged with a BGPMON_SEQ node that contains both values.

When a BGPmon receives a message from a chained BGPmon, it checks the id.  If this is the first
message seen from this id, the id is associated internally with the specific chain thread that
received the message.  Then as more messages come in, duplicates that come in from different
chains are dropped.  This way, downstream BGPmon instances are not inundated with duplicate
messages.

2.2		STATUS_MSG
To conform to the XFB specification, the BGP_MESSAGE is still used as the root element of every
message output from BGPmon.  However, BGPmon uses a new element called STATUS_MSG to communicate
information about the internal state of a BGPmon instance.

   The STATUS_MSG contains one of four kinds of messages: MRT_STATUS,
   SESSION_STATUS, and CHAIN_STATUS, BGPMON_STATUS, representing the
   operation status of any connected MRT collectors, BGP peering routers,
   peering BGPMon server, and the BGPMon server and its queues respectively.
	+---------------+
	| STATUS_MSG    |
	+---------------+
	|               |<>--+--[ SESSION_STATUS ]
	|               |    |--[ CHAIN_STATUS   ]
	|               |    |--[ MRT_STATUS	   ]
	|               |    |--[ BGPMON_STATUS  ]
	+---------------+

                        Figure 1: STATUS_MSG class

2.2.1  BGPMON_STATUS / QUEUE

   BGPMON_STATUS includes a BGPMON_UP node that contains information
	about the uptime of the associated BGPMON.  The BGPMON_STATUS message
	also includes zero or
	multiple child QUEUE elements, which in
   turn carry the information about BGPMon internal message queues.
	+---------------+
	| BGPMON_STATUS |
	+---------------+
	|INTEGER count	|<>-------- +-------------------+
	|				|			| BGPMON_UP			|

                          Figure 2: BGPMON_STATUS

   The BGPMON_STATUS contains the following attributes:

   count
      INTEGER.  The number of QUEUE elements.

	The BGPMON_UP contains the following attributes:
		INTEGER last_down - the timestamp of the last time the BGPMON instance went down
		INTEGER uptime - how long the BGPMON has been up

   QUEUE
      Zero or more.  The QUEUE element which is described as the
      following.

   The QUEUE element contains the following elements

- NAME: Human readable name. BGPmon reports status of the Peer Queue, Label
Queue, XML Update Queue and XML RIB Queue.

- ITEM, READER, WRITER
These elements contain the integer number of messages, reader, and writers in the queue, 
respectively.  In addition, the following two attributes are defined for each of them:

- INTEGER max: An attribute containing the greatest number of stored messages seen.
- INTEGER limit: An attribute containing the maximum allowed number of messages in the queue.
For READER and WRITER, these are always set to 0.

- PACING
The PACING element includes information about the pacing being used by BGPmon.  It holds three
elements:

- FLAG: Contains a boolean value to indicate whether or not pacing is being used on this queue.
Please refer to the BGPmon specification for more information on pacing.
- COUNT: Holds an integer that counts how many times the queue has had pacing enabled. Also
has max and limit attributes as described above, but should be ignored.
- WRITE_LIMIT: Contains an integer to indicate the maximum allowed writes from a single writer.
Only valid while pacing is turned on.  Also has unused max and limit attributes.


2.2.2.  CHAIN_STATUS / CHAIN

   CHAIN_STATUS includes zero or multiple child CHAIN elements.

2.2.4.	MRT_STATUS
BGPmon accepts connections from directly peered routers as well as MRT collectors.  The MRT_STATUS
message is meant to provide information about both the state of the connected MRT collectors as
well as information about the routers connected to the collectors.

							Figure 5: The MRT_STATUS and child elements

- MRT
Zero or more.  The MRT element contains the following elements:

- ADDR: Contains the address of the peering collector.
- PORT: Contains the port number the collector is connected to (179 by default).
- AS: Contains the source AS of the peering collector.
- UPTIME: Contains the length of time the collector has been up for.
- RESET: Contains the timestamp of the last time the collector went down.

- SESSION
Zero or more. The SESSION element is defined exactly as in section 2.2.3.


3.	Extensions to existing XFB items
BGPmon adds several additional elements and attributes to existing XFB elements.  These are defined
below.

3.1. BGP_MESSAGE

- INTEGER type_value: To avoid potential collisions in the IANA database for BGP message type codes,
we use type codes 256-266 for our internal BGPmon messages.  These are defined as follows:

BMF_TYPE_RESERVED			256
BMF_TYPE_MSG_TO_PEER		257
BMF_TYPE_MSG_FROM_PEER		258
BMF_TYPE_MSG_LABELED		259
BMF_TYPE_TABLE_TRANSFER		260
BMF_TYPE_SESSION_STATUS		261
BMF_TYPE_QUEUES_STATUS		262
BMF_TYPE_CHAINS_STATUS		263
BMF_TYPE_FSM_STATE_CHANGE	264
BMF_TYPE_BGPMON_START		265
BMF_TYPE_BGPMON_STOP		266
BMF_TYPE_TABLE_START		267
BMF_TYPE_TABLE_STOP			268
BMF_TYPE_MRT_STATUS			277

These can appear in the output stream of BGPmon, especially types 260-268 and 277.  Generally, types 257-259
include some actual BGP message, and so would be represented by the appropriate BGP message type.

- STRING type: In addition to the defined BGP message types
 (OPEN,UPDATE,NOTIFICATION,KEEPALIVE,ROUTE_REFRESH), we also use TABLE_START (type 267) and TABLE_STOP
 (type 268) to denote the beginning or end of a sending of a peer's RIB table, TABLE for messages 
within a table transfer (type 260) and STATUS for BGPmon status messages (types 261,262,263,265,266).

3.2. PEERING

- INTEGER as_num_len: An attribute that indicates whether the peer uses 2-byte or 4-byte AS numbers.
Obviously, the valid values for this attribute are 2 and 4.
- BGPID: An element containing the BGP Identifier for the peer.  This often comes up as 0.0.0.0

3.3. ASCII_MSG

- INTEGER type: An attribute indicating the type code of the BGP message.

3.4. MARKER, OCTETS

- INTEGER length: An attribute listing theThe READER element lists the current number of readers on a given queue.  It also
has an INTEGER max attribute as defined above.  Current BGPmon output also includes the
limit attribute as defined above, but a value of 0 is always assigned to it. length in octets of the element.

3.5. WITHDRAWN, PATH_ATTRIBUTES, NLRI

- INTEGER count: An attribute that lists the number of PREFIX elements (for WITHDRAWN or NLRI), or 
ATTRIBUTE elements (for the PATH_ATTRIBUTES element).

3.6. TYPE, AFI, SAFI, PARAMETER, CAP, ATTRIBUTE

- INTEGER value: An attribute that lists the numerical code for the human-readable value in the element.

3.7. PREFIX

- STRING label: An attribute that indicates whether a given prefix is a duplicate or new announcement or
is on a new or duplicate path or is a new or duplicate withdrawl.

3.8. AS_SEG

- INTEGER length: An attribute that contains the number of AS numbers in the particular AS_SEG.
